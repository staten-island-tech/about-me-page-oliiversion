     <p>I am sorry to announce that I am short, below average height. A guy at the height of 5"5'. I am a sophmore at Staten Island Technical High School, currently fifteen years old. I got green and black hair and many rings. Very easy to spot. I love to sing, draw, write, play instruments, anything artsy really. I'm a fan of Marvel and I am pretty cool.</p>
